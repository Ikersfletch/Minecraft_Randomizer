# Minecraft-Randomizer
A light-weight program which creates a randomized behavior pack for use with Minecraft, made with Processing 3.

# Installation
Download the latest release and unzip the file. 

# Use
Upon opening the Program, you can choose various options to limit the randomization.
All of the World Generation Options (as of Minecraft version 1.16.2) require the use of Experimental Gameplay to function.

Once you have chosen your settings, click the 'generate' button.

You'll find the randomized content in 'generated_files/behavior_pack'

Open the 'behavior_pack' folder and select all of its contents, and zip them into a compressed (zipped) folder.

Change the file extension of the new '.zip' folder to '.mcpack'.

Double click to install into Minecraft.

Go back to the 'generated_files' folder and remove any files found within it. Failure to do so could cause unwanted changes, as the program can only replace files, not delete them.

# Recommended Settings
It's recommended to turn the render distance as far down as it will go when generating the world; even on high-end systems the randomized world generation performs abysmally.
It's recommended to have Experimental Gameplay enabled.
It's recommended to not mix the Randomized Packs with other behavior packs.
